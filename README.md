Slicer
======

<p>Purpose:<br/>
Slice images with a grid knife. In another word, crop multiple images into many rectangular pieces.</p>

<p>How it work:<br/>
Set the directory path. Type...<br/>
$slicer -go c:\folder1\folder2
<br/>
Set the number of slice you want. Type...<br/>
$slicer -slice 3x5</p>

<p>Note:<br/>
3x5 means 3 columns and 5 rows.<br/>
Currently the valid image formats are .jpg, .jpg, .png, .gif<//p>

<p>It's just a console application. I needed this feature for my another project quickly, so I made this. Maybe it will be helpful to someone who also needs a tool like this. To save time, I did't consider making it as a program with GUI. However, in the future, if I need more features from it, I'll certainly change it to an application with GUI.</p>

<p>Oh, type c to quit the program.</p>
