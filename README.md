Slicer
======

Purpose:
Slice images with a grid knife. In another word, crop multiple images into many rectangular pieces.

How it work:
Set the directory path. 
ex:$slicer -go c:\folder1\folder2

Set the number of slice you want. 
ex:$slicer -slice 3x5

Note:
3x5 means 3 columns and 5 rows.
Currently the valid image formats are .jpg, .jpg, .png, .gif

It's just a console application. I needed this feature for my another project quickly, so I made this. Maybe it will be helpful to someone who also needs a tool like this. To save time, I did't consider making it as a program with GUI. However, in the future, if I need more features from it, I'll certainly change it to an application with GUI.
